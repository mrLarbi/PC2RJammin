Server side.

The server side is implemented using Java 8.

1. Creating  new Project
Create a new Java Project in Eclipse. Right click on the created project and choose Import.
From the list provided click the option Archive file; It should be under the General sub-menu. 

2. Compiling the project. 
We use ant scripts to compile our server. To do so. Open your command terminal. Move to your 
eclipse's workspace and eventually to the newly created Java Project. 

The command "ant compile" will compile the server.
To execute the server use the command "ant srun".

NB: Make sure to have the ant software installed. Otherwise sources can be compiled using java commands
    using the terminal console. Do not forget command line arguments when running the server else default ones
    will be used.
